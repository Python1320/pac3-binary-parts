{"name":"pac3-binary-parts","tagline":"PAC3 parts with a dependency on clientside binary modules","body":"## PAC3 Binary Parts\r\n\r\nHere are a set of PAC3 parts that aren't included in mainline pac3 because they have a dependency on clientside binary modules. Naturally, they require pac3 to function.\r\n\r\n## Included parts\r\n\r\n###vfs\r\nAllows downloading of files to support other pac3 parts. Right now it only supports being used with the model part but this part is under heavy development and this could change.\r\nDepends on the VFS Module, which you can obtain from [here](https://github.com/suchipi/pac3-binary-parts/releases/download/vfs-12%2F13%2F2014/gmcl_vfs_win32.dll).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nThe lua code can be downloaded as a .tar.gz or .zip above, or you can clone the [git repo](https://github.com/suchipi/pac3-binary-parts.git). The lua code can just go in a folder in addons as per usual.\r\nAll the clientside modules should be placed in GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin (Note: Won't work from addons, needs to be placed in your real GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin)\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\n\r\n* CapsAdmin for writing PAC3 and putting up with my bullshit\r\n* Zeh Matt for writing the original VFS Module\r\n* Python1320 for getting the VFS module working in Gmod 13 and adding RemoveFile and RemoveDir\r\n* Meta Construct for letting me test there and putting up will all my github madness","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
